The easiest way to identify which Bitsy Expander flavor you own is checking the label on the back of the board. **RP2040** or **M4** stated on the label indicates the flavor of your Expander. Some M4 Expanders have an **empty label** (and are also recognizable by the lack of an IÂ²C header at the top).
