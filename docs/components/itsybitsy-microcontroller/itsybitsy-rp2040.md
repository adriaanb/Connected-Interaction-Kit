The ItsyBitsy RP2040 is a versatile development board powered by a 32-bit Cortex M0+ microcontroller. Compared to the ItsyBitsy M4, the RP2040 replaces two analog pins with two additional digital pins. The RP2040 affords greater flexibility in GPIO pin usage, but extra planning and research may be needed to fully leverage this advantage.
