# Cover Pattern Generator

A [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketch to generate cover art for the booklet.

At the top of [sketch.js](sketch.js), user-definable parameters, and constraints are defined. The sketch will keep generating patterns until one fits the required conditions. By pressing the return key, the currently displayed design is saved. Pressing any other key will dismiss the current pattern and resume generating others.

All necessary files are bundled in a zip archive available for download [here](pattern_generator.zip). After unpacking, the index.html file may be opened locally in any web browser.
